					<description><![CDATA[I
  Just went down to the American Airline Ticket Office at 360 Lexington Avenue and found that it was closed. 
The service there was absolutely terrific!  They had been there for years and really represented the company well.  I even knew some of their names-Karen Johnson, Joanne Golio.  They made me love American Airlines so I wouldn&#039;t take anything else if I didn&#039;t have to. What a shame!  Think of it.  American Airlines does not have a ticket office in New York City!]]></description>
