					<description><![CDATA[Hello Air India,
I am currently staying in Seoul and would like to book a round trip ticket to Mumbai. 
I saw recently direct flight is going to Seoul-Delhi, and for the Mumbai we need to again take a domestic flight. In this regard, I have a question. When we reach Delhi, do we need to collect the luggage or it will be automatically going to domestic flight for Mumbai? And we directly collect luggage at Mumbai.

While coming from Mumbai, do we need to perform immigration check at Mumbai or Delhi IGI airport?]]></description>
