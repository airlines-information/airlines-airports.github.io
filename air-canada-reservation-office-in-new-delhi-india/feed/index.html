					<description><![CDATA[Dear team ,
We have issued one Air Canada ticket in favour of Mrs  Varghese/ Shila

Ticket number  0143757144988  to travel  Bom –yyz- ylw ( sector )on 17 march 2020 .travel date 

This ticket we issued through Alhind tours and travels cochin – India 

She was holding visit visa to Canada . on that particular day the Canadian government introduced a rule on 17th march  night 

That those who holding visit visa cannot travel to Canada .

So I can’t cancel the reservation  and  the passenger can’t enter the airport .

So I would like to know this passenger will get full refund (   the Canadian government rule implemented on that night only )

So there is no fault from passenger side 

Why I send to these mail ids because INDIAN toll number is not working . so please send me the reply at the earliest to help my client to get the refund processed 
another  enquiry  is del yyz ac 43 is operating for  08 Sep   can i issue tickets son this airline.is it a normal  flight 

hope i will get the  reply   i send several mail to  air candida  and i am not getting any reply so please do it]]></description>
