					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have tried to reach call center so many times but failed. This type of services are pathetic. If you are not there when some one looking for help or need you guys urgently then no point of opening call centers. We are trying from past 4 hours to speak to someone and still trying but no response. Absolutely third class service.]]></description>
