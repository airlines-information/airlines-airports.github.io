Hi, should you confirm the charter flight from POM to Manila back for PX 9011 on the 21st June 2020. Please let me know because there is going to be cargoes sent through this flight from Manila to POM. We are unable to get to the right contact here in Manila.

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Air Niugini Agent in Manila, Philipines,

My name is Nida Sirinut Manprakhon and I have been traveling from Sweden to Papua New Guinea via Air Niugini for three times.

However, I purchased a ticket to travel from Sweden to PNG and there is a slight mistake in my name. i an due to travel in less than a couple days time. 

MY ORIGINAL NAME IS &quot;NIDA SIRINUT MANPRAKHON&quot; as shown in my passport. However, the travel agent made a mistake by writing my name as &quot;NIDA SINUT MANPRAKHON&quot;. 

My middle name should be &quot;SIRINUT&quot; and NOT &quot;SINUT&quot; as shown on my ticket.

Here is my booking reference: Old one is QUIJOZH and new one is RCU6K6. 

Air Quatar has agreed to allow me travel to Manila. I want to ask if Air Niugini can allow me to travel to PORT MORESBY, PNG.

THANK YOU!]]></description>
