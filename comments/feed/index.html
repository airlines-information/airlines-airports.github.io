					<description><![CDATA[My daughters booked a flight with Qatar Airways from Vienna to Zanzibar from 8th till 17th September 2021. Due to a postponed start of their studies, they will not be able to start the journey. On your website it says that tickets that have not been used are valid for 2 years.
Unfortunately my daughters did not book their flights to Zanzibar directly with Qatar Airways but via Flugladen.at.  Every contact with Flugladen, Cheap Tickets and Travix has failed so far. But apparently no rebooking is possible. Therefore I turn to you with the request for support: We understand that there are rebooking fees with Flugladen, but why should it be completely impossible while you state completely different conditions on your website?
Thank you in advance for your valued feedback!
