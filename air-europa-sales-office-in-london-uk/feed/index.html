					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying to reach them of their customer service phone but the call does not get through at all!

They said that due to internal problems they can not attend any call ?? seriously? no way to ask about anything?

I need to know if I can travel from UK to Spain (Gran Canaria) on September with my cat and I need a confirmation of this and know the price and what I need to do to book him as well. so I can arrange all the other things that I need to consider such us requirements etc. 

Can you please help?
Many thanks in advance
Kind regards]]></description>
