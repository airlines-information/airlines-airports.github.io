					<description><![CDATA[Hello. I sent a message yesterday. I have a flight to denver from Purto vallarta scheduled this morning. I have been unable to contact you all as I want to cancel, due to the corona virus issue. I was unable to access the phone number you all ga e as customer servoce. I Tried for 3 hpurs. Then I tried to use the o. Line feature ( after I finally found it) and the screen kept telli g me &quot; this flight is closed&quot;.
 I am in a small village 2 hrs from Puerto Vallerta with no car, could not get in to change this at PV.
It hasbeen impossible to change my flight thei amy of your official avenues.
Nationally, Frontier has issued a no fee change/ promise to honor these tickets. It was stated that you would issue us a voucher for travel, good for 90 days. How do I make this happen?
Please contact me,
