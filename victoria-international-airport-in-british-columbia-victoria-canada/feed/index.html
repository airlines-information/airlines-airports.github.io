					<description><![CDATA[I plan to arrive at the Victoria International Airport by plane from Santiago, Chile,
perhaps Saturday or Sunday or maybe even Monday.
I don&#039;t have a fixed schedule drawn up, but I think it will not be very complicated.

I hope to take a taxi or limousine to wherever I should go for the 14 days of insulation.
Guidance may prove valuable here.

I have grown children living in the USA, near Port Angeles expecting to see me
soon after the 14 days are up.
(They are citzens of the USA, but I am not.)

Thank you for your attention.
