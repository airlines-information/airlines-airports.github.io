					<description><![CDATA[Air Niguini office in Mt Hagen customer service is very bad. On Saturdays, only one staff is working on International office and only one staff is working at the domestic counter. There are more than 60 people waiting to be served.  Those who were in line since 8am are still standing inline while those with special passes just March in and are served as priority. 
It seems favouritism is being played.
There should be two lines created for both international and two lines for domestics.
Those with special passes being in one line and those without special passes can have one line on both domestic and international customer service So that every customer is served equally. 
I have experienced it first end today. I arrived at 9am and I was told by the securities to stand in the line to be served at the international customer service counter. As I was standing in the line, I watched people with special passes were allowed to jump the line and being served. I am still waiting to be served at the international customer service  because I don&#039;t  have a special pass and it&#039;s two hours now.
Mr Hagen airnuigini office need to put customers needs ahead and put more staffs at work even on the weekend&#039;s. This is Saturday and only two staffs are working.]]></description>
