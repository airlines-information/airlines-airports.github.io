					<description><![CDATA[I have made bookings on 27 Dec 2019 (Booking reference : VSPLSQ from FTE to USH) and 30 Dec (Reference XRARFS fro USH to Buenos Aires).  I have purchase checkin baggage for 15kg but would actually like to purchase the option for 23kg but was not given a choice.  Hence, I have purchase another extra 15kg.  Can I check on the following : a) Whether I can combine the weight into one luggage not exceeding 30kg.  b) Would you be able to help us purchase baggage upgrade to 23kg since I cannot do online  c) Ny e-ticket shows only 1 baggage.  Can you confirm the purchase of the extra luggage (15kg)  d) How do I select seats for my flight?]]></description>
