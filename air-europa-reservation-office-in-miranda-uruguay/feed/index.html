					<description><![CDATA[BUSINESS CLASS DISASTER

AIR EUROPA LOST MY BAGS ON AN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT FROM MONTEVIDEO TO MADRID CONNECTING TO LONDON AND DUBLIN AND ACT LIKE IM TO BLAME AS I DIDNT GET THE CHANCE/ TIME TO REPORT AT THEIR DESK IN MADRID. I along with 4 other business class and 2 economy passengers from flight UX046 on 5th August stood waiting to be attended to for over an hour. There were no paper forms to fill up while waiting in  a queue. I had in the end to run for my flight and made it with 15mins to go after being given wrong directions by BA business class checkin.

No satisfactuon TO DATE from lost baggage offices.

CAN BAGS SIMPLY DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR AND NO BE ACCOUNTABLE??

NEARLY €4000 for a flight to get home to see my family after a year AND NO ONE GIVES a dam!!!!

YOU SHOLD BE ASHAMED OF THAT KIND OF SERVICE!!!!]]></description>
