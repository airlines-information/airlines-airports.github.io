					<description><![CDATA[After 5 perfect flights I&#039;m now being prevented from travelling with my bags of medication I need for my 2 disabilities 
This became a problem (it never was on 5 flights before nor on 25 flights with Icelandair) when an aggressive bully on your staff at Akureyri Airport refused to comply with IATA, Human Rights and Disability Law. I was prevented from boarding by him twice AFTER he had issued me a boarding pass I called Police he was terrorising me a vulnerable person.   I was trapped in Akureyri my home for three days buying new air tickets and a Hotel night In  KEF for my connecting  flight  to UK twice. I lost about £700.
Pro Consul British Embassy is now involved re my next flight to my HOME in Akuyreyri on Weds 4 Dec from Reykjavik at 1545. Your airline is not being helpful preventing me flying with a valid ticket I already have. I have no choice about needing medication and it is 16 meds hence 4 extra bags in all. I have letters from my 2 Doctors saying I need these medications. If I checked them in they might get lost or contents stolen I can&#039;t replace them in time to save my life I would be dead inn2 days without them not to mention excruciating pain. Will you please escalate this matter to the top urgently your customer service agents are not being helpful to the Embassy or me.]]></description>
