					<description><![CDATA[Sir,
Following problems noticed with your services:
1) In case, transit is involved in an International Flight through Air Canada,
the travelleros should be intimated correctly while booking the tickets.
Air Canada does not do it.
2) International Flights operate generally in the night.
But your Customer service number works only 9 AM to 5 PM as noted in
New Delhi.  ..Very distressful...
What type of services then travelers in need can expect?
Pl, inform me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really need Air Canada to work on its online booking site! I have used AC 32 times from Hong Kong to Calgary over the past 10 years  without a problem and  loyally support the airline. However, my recent attempt at booking has been highly distressing. I attempted to make a booking on line for July 28 from HK to Calgary as I usually do .  When it came to payment  it kept spinning, and after 40 minutes I assumed it had not gone through so I redid it on another computer, but it also spun for ever on payment.I checked my Visa account the next day and to my surprise it showed payment pending for TWO tickets, but I had not received any confirmation number from AC. I waited but no confirmation .I called AC but could not get through at HK office (only Chinese) and after 35 minutes on the phone on hold  to Canada  I called Visa again.They said it was  an AC problem and likely AC would cancel these as they did not confirm with booking reference. With this in mind I booked a new ticket-and the price had increased- through a family member in Canada  using my  Visa  card-no problem  and I got a  booking reference  QL35EE. Now the two &quot;pending &quot; tickets have turned up on my Visa as  Posted Transactions so I have been charged  for these but with no confirmation ! These are for $1913.41- approved code 089805, and $1939.14- approved code 016555. So, now I have three charges for one AC ticket one way to Calgary ! I have tried numerous times to get AC on the phone in Canada as all attempts to contact AC Hong Kong have been fruitless.Visa says you are responsible for reimbursing  this ,not them. I , unfortunately, am stuck in the middle ,helpless and quite honestly, broke. As a loyal AC supporter, I beg  you to deal with this as quickly as possible. This is so distressing and frustrating and  can be easily solved by someone at AC taking control of this mistake and rectifying it. I wish to remain a loyal AC customer and know I can count on your support.    Please contact me by email or phone +853 6251 8765 or whatshap +853 6243 5146.]]></description>
