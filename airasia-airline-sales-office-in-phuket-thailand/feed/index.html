					<description><![CDATA[This complaint is not directed at the Air Asia Phuket branch however it is directed at Air Asia. 
When it comes to getting a refund due to a medical emergency and they agree to a refund on compassionate grounds, you hit a brick wall.

&quot;In response to your email, we are pleased to offer you a &#039;Credit Account&#039; on compassionate grounds.&quot;

They will not return emails, they are near impossible to get hold of and generally just muck you around. It&#039;s a real shame because they are  great value to fly with, always on time and I usually never have any complaints. But they have dropped the ball badly on this occasion. 1/10.]]></description>
