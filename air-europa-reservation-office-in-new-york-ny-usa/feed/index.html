					<description><![CDATA[My wife and I are scheduled to fly on Air Europa from JFK to Madrid &#038; then Madrid to Malaga on March 7,2020.  We have flown on Air Europa many times.  On March 3, 2020, I called your customer service in an effort to change our flight to this mid-May.  My wife and I are in our late 70s, retired, and we are concerned with the reported Coronavirus cases in Madrid and Malaga and other parts of Andalucia.  The Spanish news today reports 250 cases and 2 deaths.  I was informed my ticket price would be increased by $335 plus there would be a $190 cancellation fee because Spain had not yet declared a national emergency!  Our decision is not based on a whim but on the real and present danger caused by the virus. Because of the virus other airlines-American, Delta and United-are waiving change fees, cutting flights, etc. Has Air Europa&#039;s increased ticket price/ cancellation fee policy changed in view of the increased Coronavirus cases in Spain?  I&#039;m sure my wife and I are not the only Air Europa customers seeking to change their flights because of the virus.  Thank you for your attention to our concerns.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please help me regarding the flight my husband and I took from Madrid to TLV at the end of July, 2 months ago. Our LEKI walking sticks were taken away from us by Security at the Madrid Airport. Even though Air Europa lists walking sticks on your website, we have not been able to reach anyone who will help us with this issue. I wrote a letter to the office in TLV and they sent it on to Spain, with no result. Who else might be able to solve this issue?]]></description>
