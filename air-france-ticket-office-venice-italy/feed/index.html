					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,
 
On 3rd September i booked ticket for Belgium from Venice Italy for 3600 dkk for Dipendra Thapa and Maya Chamlagai just before 3 hr of departure. when we moved on check in, the staff there said that it is not valid, hence we went to Air france ticket counter and staff there said that we have to buy ticket again and she also said that previous booked ticket amount will be refunded later. Therefore consecutively we bought ticket again but the previous booked ticket amount has not been yet refunded in respective account. it is already 16th September today and respective account holder has not received the amount yet. Is it carelessness of Air France? Below i have attached the information and evidences, booking reference number. Desperate for your reply. hope a clear concentration towards this.

Flying from -Marcopollo airport, Italy  to Belgium via transit Paris
Time - between 16-17
booking reference- N8FATX]]></description>
