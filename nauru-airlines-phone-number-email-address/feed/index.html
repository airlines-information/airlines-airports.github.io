					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

My e-ticket number is 724-3583228165 for LX358. 

I would like to know;

1. How much free cabin luggage I can carry?
2. How and when can I check in? Can I do it online?

Please could you let me know asap, as I am going for an Eurotrip with my parents and we have to leave tomorrow. So, that we can carry according to your advice.]]></description>
