					<description><![CDATA[Dear Aer Lingus

I live in 41, Dean Street, Newlands.

Thank you for your booking confirmation, see below.

When should I expect  the electronic ticket and the option to print my boarding pass?

When should I check in?

I made the booking through SKY SCANNERS, who then routed me to E-DREAMS who then made the booking for an amount of R924.35 in South African Rands (ZAR), but charged me a MEDIATION FEE of R R893-52.  I am currently disputing this exorbitant amount with E-DREAMS via my South African bank, FIRST NATIONAL BANK, whose FRAUD section phoned me last night, soon after the transaction went through.  It was late in the evening and the flight booking is crucial to my travel plans.

I really need your assistance in this matter.

In June, 2013, we flew from Shannon to Heathrow with no trouble at all.

Yours faithfully

(Dr) John Rogers

Retired University of Cape Town (UCT) Geology Lecturer, schooled in Counties Antrim and Down.

P.S.  SKY SCANNERS was recommended to me by the Profesor of Oceanography at UCT, who flies frequently.
