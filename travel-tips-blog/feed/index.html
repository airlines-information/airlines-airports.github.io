<p>No matter how much you pay for your seat, how much is your leg room or whether you’re flying first class or not, the one and only thing that many air travelers have in common is ear pain. While most ear discomfort on a flight travel is nothing more than an annoyance, what happens if it becomes more serious? Ear pain and pressure can lead to severe pain and in rare cases, hearing loss. So it’s wise to take precautions before, during and also after your flight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Ear Pain on Flight Travel</strong></p>
<p>The joy of flying is often accompanied with ear discomfort. Popularly called the ‘airplane ear’, it’s felt as prickling of the ears with slight pain. It usually happens during landing; precisely, after the pilot announces that the airplane has begun its descent. As the plane starts to land, the changes in air pressure pushes your eardrums in resulting in pain. Most of the times, you feel that your ears are blocked. While the ear tubes try to adapt to the change in atmospheric pressure, this odd sensation in the ears might become more painful for a few travelers.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-71752  aligncenter" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="330" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas.jpg 810w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas-300x167.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /></p>
<p><strong>Quick Remedies for Relief from Earn Pain</strong></p>
<p>Simply waiting for that ear discomfort to fade out will certainly not work wonders. So, here are some safe and natural methods that will quickly give you a sigh of relief.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chew Candies</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-71750 alignleft" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Candies-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Candies-300x200.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Candies.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />It’s the sweetest remedy that really works! Even if you don’t have a sweet tooth, pick some candies offered by the cabin crew before takeoff and landing. Chewing and sucking candies enables continuous movement of the jaws. It allows the air pressure in your ear to balance out by opening the Eustachian tubes.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>The Valsalva Maneuver</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This breathing technique may sound complicated, but it’s much simple and easy to do! Take a deep breath first; then close your mouth and pinch your nose. While the mouth is closed, try to blow air gently through the nostrils till you hear a popping sound. The maneuver equalizes the air pressure in your ears. However, if you have severe cold or you’re prone to allergies, avoid the Valsalva as it may lead to severe ear infection.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>The Toynbee Maneuver</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Another ear-popping method to relieve ear pain! Much alike the Valsalva, it is an effective ear-clearing technique that you can do right in your seat. The Toynbee technique involves pinching your nose gently, sipping on some water and swallowing it hard simultaneously. For better results, repeat both the maneuvers back to back till your ears are clear.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Yawning</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71751 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yawning.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="638" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yawning.jpg 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yawning-300x199.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yawning-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p>Yawning needs no rocket science. Even if you’re not sleepy try to yawn as much as you can! The wide stretching of the mouth makes the muscles active causing opening and closing of the Eustachian tubes. This balances the air pressure outside. Repeat every few minutes until your ears pop.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Pop your ears</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You must have tried this child’s play, years back. Time to regain! Pinch your nose closing it with your fingers and then blow through your nose until you feel your ears &#8216;pop’. Popping ears are effective in opening the ear tubes and regulating the air pressure in the ears.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Nasal Spray and Decongestant</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another quick relief is to use nasal spray, just an hour prior to landing and only as-needed. It will offset any swelling that might arise in the nose, hindering the air flow in the Eustachian tubes. Do not overuse nasal sprays as this may cause more congestion. Though decongestant is not a complete cure, it’s certainly an immediate relief before landing.</p>
<p><strong>Tips to Prevent Ear Pain</strong></p>
<p>As the ancient saying relates, prevention is better than cure! Below given are some expert tips that you can follow to avoid that painful episode of plugged ears.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wake up an hour before landing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This will give ample time to your ears to adjust to the change in air pressure while landing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Opt for Ear Plugs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Often called ear planes, these soft silicone earplugs are very helpful to regulate the air pressure and reduce the chances of pain caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction. Insert in your ears during takeoff and landings.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Suck on a boiled sweet</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re travelling with kids, you can give them some boiled sweets before landing. It actually works. Chewing and swallowing enables the air to flow up the Eustachian tube.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make sure you’re well enough to fly</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any ear, nose or sinus infection, avoid flying. The swelling can cause bleeding, pain or a perforated ear drum. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about decongestants to help reduce the swelling in your ears. Also check with your Physician before flying if you’ve recently had any type of ear surgery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Things You Should Check if You Have Deep Vein Thrombosis Risk</strong></p>
<p>Every year, more than 300 million people travel on long-distance flights lasting for more than four hours. For them, blood clots, also called DVT or Deep Vein Thrombosis could be a serious risk. Blood clots can form in the deep veins of your legs during travel because you’ve been sitting still in a confined space for longer period of time. The longer you’re immobile, the greater is your risk of DVT. Here is a complete round-up of DVT that will help you to recognize the symptoms and check if you have Deep Vein Thrombosis risk.</p>
<h2><strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis or (DVT) </strong></h2>
<p>When a blood clot is formed in one of the deep veins of the body, it’s called deep vein thrombosis or DVT. It appears as a swelling and is much painful. If the blood clot breaks free, it can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream. In rare cases, it can also cut off blood flow to the lungs. The biggest danger of DVT is that part of the clot could break off and travel to your lungs causing a blockage known as a pulmonary embolism or PE.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71736 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel.jpg" alt="" width="803" height="448" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel.jpg 803w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel-300x167.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></p>
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Causes of</strong> <strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis</strong></h3>
<p>Blood is meant for flowing in the veins. If it becomes stagnant, there is a potential for blood to clot. It constantly forms microscopic clots in the veins that are frequently broken down by the body. If the balance of clot formation and clot breakdown changes, this may lead to significant clotting and formation of thrombus.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Immobility</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Prolonged sitting and travel like long airplane flights, car, or train travel</li>
<li>Hospitalization</li>
<li>Surgery</li>
<li>Without surgery and casting, trauma to the lower leg</li>
<li>Pregnancy, especially after delivery of the baby</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Coagulation of the blood faster than usual (hypercoagulation)</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Medications such as birth control pillsand other estrogens</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Genetic or hereditary predisposition to clot formation</li>
<li>Polycythemia or increased number of red blood cells</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Trauma to the vein</li>
<li>Bruised leg or arm</li>
<li>Fracture to the leg or arm</li>
<li>Complication of an invasive procedure of the vein</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Symptoms of </strong><strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) </strong></h3>
<p>Symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis gradually appear when blood clots in one of the deep veins. Generally, it occurs in any vein of the leg, but it can be found in other locations too like the pelvis. However, the most serious complication of DVT is pulmonary embolism where a blood clot breaks off of the DVT and travels through the blood and clogs in a blood vessel of the lung. Symptoms observed in the overlying skin and include swelling, pain, cramping, soreness, discoloration or even a feeling of warmth in your affected leg. The affected vein can sometimes be felt as a rough thick cord beneath the skin. Symptoms of DVT are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Redness or discolored skin on the leg.</li>
<li>Warmth</li>
<li>Swelling</li>

<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Risk of Getting Deep Vein Thrombosis</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71735 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Age-above-40.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Age-above-40.jpg 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Age-above-40-300x200.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Age-above-40-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p>For many physicians, DVT is quite tough to detect. That’s why it’s always better to know what puts you at risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis so you can avoid getting it. Here are a few important things that increase your chances of DVT:</p>
<p><strong>1)You had a blood clot</strong> <strong>before</strong></p>
<p>It has been observed that nearly 30% of people who had DVT are bound to have it again.</p>
<p><strong>2) You have a family history of it</strong></p>
<p>If your parent or any sibling had DVT, you’re more at a risk of getting it. If both your parents have been diagnosed, your chances will be even higher.</p>
<p><strong>3) You’re over age 40</strong></p>
<p>Odds of getting DVT, grows with age.</p>

<p><strong>4) You’re on bed rest or sit for long periods of time</strong></p>
<p>The deep veins running in the centre of your legs depend on the leg muscles to force blood back to your lungs and heart. If your leg muscles don’t move for a while, blood starts to pool in your lower legs. This is more perceptive for a clot to form.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71737 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pregnant-Women.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pregnant-Women.jpg 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pregnant-Women-300x200.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pregnant-Women-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p><strong>5) You’re pregnant or just gave birth</strong></p>
<p>If you’re expecting a baby, biologically, your levels of the hormone estrogens will rise. This causes the blood to clot more easily. On the other hand, if you take birth control pills or some sort of hormone replacement therapy, your chances of DVT also goes up. That’s because most of these drugs contain estrogen.</p>
<p><strong>6) Your blood doesn’t clot like it should</strong></p>
<p>A few people are born with a blood clotting disorder. This causes your blood to be thicker than normal when it circulates through your body.</p>
<p><strong>7) You need to lose weight</strong></p>
<p>The greater your body mass index (BMI), the higher your risk for DVT will be. BMI measures how much fat you have compared to your weight and height.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71738 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Over-Weight.png" alt="" width="960" height="637" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Over-Weight.png 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Over-Weight-300x199.png 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Over-Weight-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p><strong>8) You have other health issues</strong></p>
<p>Those with heart disease, lung disease and inflammatory bowel disease are more likely to get DVT. Also those with cancer or are going through cancer treatment are prone to DVT..</p>
<p><strong>9) Your vein has been injured</strong></p>
<p>If you have badly hurt your muscle or fractured your bone, the inner lining of a nearby vein might have been damaged. This may lead to a clot. Major surgeries in stomach, leg, pelvis, hip also makes you more prone to DVT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having high blood pressure should not hinder while traveling and keep you from enjoying a globe-trotting lifestyle. Any type of journey, including flying, is equally fine and comfortable as long as you have high blood pressure and it’s well controlled. However, if your blood pressure is unstable and not controlled by medication, then you should talk to your doctor before you make any travel plans.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-71720 alignleft" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/High-Blood-Pressure-Patients-Quick-Guide-for-Flight-Travel-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/High-Blood-Pressure-Patients-Quick-Guide-for-Flight-Travel-300x300.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/High-Blood-Pressure-Patients-Quick-Guide-for-Flight-Travel-150x150.jpg 150w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/High-Blood-Pressure-Patients-Quick-Guide-for-Flight-Travel-768x768.jpg 768w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/High-Blood-Pressure-Patients-Quick-Guide-for-Flight-Travel.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><strong>Know Your Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Before your trip, it’s necessary to measure your systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Be cognizant of your numbers before traveling. Blood pressure is generally classified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal Blood Pressure; when systolic pressure is below 120 and diastolic pressure is below 80 mmHg.</li>
<li>Prehypertension; when systolic pressure is between120-139 or diastolic pressure is between 80-89 mmHg.</li>
<li>Hypertension; when systolic pressure is more than 140 or diastolic pressure is above 90 mmHg.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Know the Hypertension Symptoms</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71719 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Headache-symptoms-for-High-Blood-Pressure.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Headache-symptoms-for-High-Blood-Pressure.jpg 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Headache-symptoms-for-High-Blood-Pressure-300x200.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Headache-symptoms-for-High-Blood-Pressure-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p>Being aware of the signs and symptoms of hypertension can lessen risk. While high blood pressure does not carry noticeable symptoms, yet there are a few things that must not be ignored:</p>
<ul>
<li>A headache</li>
<li>Persistent aches and pains</li>
<li>Fainting</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks Associated With Flying</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):</strong> If your blood pressure is high, there is a greater risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). It is a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the deep leg veins. So take precautions by wearing comfortable and loose-fitting clothes, bending and straightening your legs frequently, massaging your calf muscles, and walking up and down the aisles if possible for proper blood circulation.</p>
<p><strong>Earache or Temporary Hearing Loss:</strong> While flying, the change in altitude occurs so quickly that it doesn’t allow your ears to adjust to the air pressure outside. This results in the dreaded earache and temporary hearing loss. To avoid, drink lots of fluids and consume chewing gums and candies.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Before You Fly</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Talk to your doctor before you go</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Before you board your flight, visit your doctor and inform him of your travel plans. In case your blood pressure is unstable or very high, your doctor can check and determine whether or not you should fly. If your doctor deems it’s unsafe for you to fly, he can change your travel plans or recommend a better time for travel.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71718 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Take-Safety-Medication-Kit-High-Blood-Pressure-in-Flight-Travel.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Take-Safety-Medication-Kit-High-Blood-Pressure-in-Flight-Travel.jpg 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Take-Safety-Medication-Kit-High-Blood-Pressure-in-Flight-Travel-300x200.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Take-Safety-Medication-Kit-High-Blood-Pressure-in-Flight-Travel-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Medication</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are on constant blood pressure medication and your journey involves you to be far from home for more than a couple of weeks, make sure you carry enough medication to last for the entire long duration. Not to forget the prescription and your doctor’s contact details.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Blood Pressure Checker</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To be on the safer side, invest in a good blood pressure monitor so you can keep an eye on your blood pressure whilst you’re away and ensure that it remains within a safe blood pressure range.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Travel Insurance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Consider safeguarding your trip with good travel insurance. While paying for insurance, declare your high blood pressure as a pre-existing medical condition. It will ensure that you are totally covered if anything happens and you need to cancel your trip or seek medical attention.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71717 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Travel-Insurance-for-Flight-Travel.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="554" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Travel-Insurance-for-Flight-Travel.jpg 1024w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Travel-Insurance-for-Flight-Travel-300x162.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Travel-Insurance-for-Flight-Travel-768x416.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><strong>Safety Tips When Flying</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t Just Sit:</strong> Try to loiter around now and then. Every 2 hours get up and move about the alley as this will ensure blood circulation and reduce the risk of clots.</li>
<li><strong>Eat Smart:</strong> Carry your own snacks and avoid the salty ones served during the flight. Salt will increase fluid retention and can increase blood pressure levels</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Alcohol &amp; Sedatives:</strong> They can make you less active during the flight. Avoiding them will decrease your pain and swelling.</li>
<li><strong>Ice It:</strong> Ice-pack offers great relief in swellings and pain. Make sure to carry one before boarding.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Medicines Handy:</strong> Pack your medication in your hand luggage so that it’s accessible whenever required. Pack extra medicines to cover for any loss or delays.</li>
<li><strong>See Your Doctor:</strong> Before flying, remember to check in with your physician. He or she might make recommendations for supplemental oxygen therapy before the flight.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Packing checklist to travel in the flight</h2>
<p>No matter what the length of your trip is: be it a weekend beach getaway or a three-week mountainous trek, you surely need to pack a bag, and you’ll always want to pack it right. There’s quite a lot to consider while determining what to bring: your itinerary, the type of your trip, weather, size of your luggage and any weight limits imposed by your mode of transportation. While so many factors come into play, it’s easy to over pack or under pack, especially if you’ve waited until the last minute. To avoid the last-minute packing and make your travel less stressful and hassle-free, here is a travel packing checklist for reference.</p>
<h2>Luggage</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19637" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Excess-baggage.png" alt="" width="400" height="324" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Excess-baggage.png 400w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Excess-baggage-300x243.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>What to pack? Travel lurks between weight, space, and convenience.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Suitcase:</strong> It really depends on where exactly you’re going and for how long you’re going to travel, but carrying a good, light, and quality suitcase is much recommended. Not many destinations are a backpacker´s paradise, so a good suitcase where all your clothes and most of your toiletries can fit in is a better choice.</li>
<li><strong> Carry-On:</strong> Embrace the simplicity; c<em>arry</em>-on is the way to go. Well, you really don&#8217;t need that much craps while travelling. Use carry-on bag and the good thing about it is that it’s handy, keeps you hassle free at the airport and brings about ease of transportation.</li>
<li><strong> Laundry Bags:</strong>Don’t miss them if you’re travelling for a longer period and don’t want your dirty and clean clothes to get mixed up.</li>
<li><strong> Packing Cubes:</strong>Packing Cubes are the new must-items when it comes to travelling, they are very handy and they also come in cool colours.</li>
<li><strong> Passport Holder</strong>: It might not sound a great requisite, but it cannot be ignored either. This bigger colourful wallet is of great essence as it holds your passport and flight tickets all in one place.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Toiletries</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71679" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Toiletries_Travel_Checklist.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="521" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Toiletries_Travel_Checklist.jpg 700w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Toiletries_Travel_Checklist-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Packing is a daunting task for any type or length of the trip. One thing you certainly don’t want to forget is your toiletries! Especially if you’re travelling by air, bringing your necessary toiletries on board is a good idea. From deodorant to floss, make sure you check this twice before leaving home.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Travel Toiletry Bag and Travel Refill Bottles: </strong>One of the essential items to keep all your toiletries in one place is the travel toiletry bag. It has sufficient space to keep the bare minimum essentials. Also use the travel bottles to refill with your own organic products in case you’re not likely to use shampoo &amp; conditioner provided by hotels.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Sunscreen and Moisturizer:</strong> Super important for every trip! While sunscreen is important if you’re basking in the sun at a sea beach, moisturizer cannot be ignored if the climate turns cold and dry.</li>
<li><strong> Cosmetics:</strong> Face creams, lip balms, mascaras, make-up brushes, nail polish with remover, tissue papers, face wipes, cotton swabs, hairbrush, shampoo bottle of smaller size and hair conditioner can be kept in a separate plastic bag.</li>
<li><strong> Perfumes and Deodorants:</strong> Go for a refillable travel size perfume bottle. You can still cling on to your fragrances.</li>
<li><strong> Toothbrush and Mini Toothpaste: </strong>Something that really start up your day! You would certainly not tend to forget it. If you’re used to mouthwash or dental floss, make sure slip them in your toiletry bag.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Clothing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71680" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Clothing_Travel_Checklist.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Clothing_Travel_Checklist.jpg 700w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Clothing_Travel_Checklist-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Choosing which clothes to pack and which one to leave at home is the toughest part. Should you pack for every occasion on your trip? Or, pack the bare minimum? For most of us, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>1. <strong>Hats:</strong> A hat is more than just an accessory. Its a must-have item especially if you plan to spend some time at the beach.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Sunglasses:</strong> Another must-have item to keep away from the bright sunrays. Adding to the style, sunglasses are an investment in healthy eyes.</li>
<li><strong> Handbags:</strong>While you must be thinking of carrying the most exotic and luxurious one for your vacation; the carry-on bag is much preferred handbag for travelling. As they are more practical and safer, you need not worry much of your valuables.</li>
<li><strong> Jewellery:</strong> Every girl’s treasure! Carrying light pieces of jewellery on a vacation is the best way to be safe without the fear of losing your precious valuables. You can replace bangles with bracelets as they can be easily slipped into zip-pocket bags. Wrap jewellery in tissue papers and keep in small plastic zipped bags.</li>
<li><strong> Casual Wear: </strong>The lightest and the super chic clothes can be part of your vacation wear. Carry T-shirts, shorts, cargos, trousers or jeans for men. Women have a vast range of casual wear to choose from tops and skirts to capris and dresses.</li>
<li><strong> Warm Clothes</strong>: Even if you’re travelling in the hotter months, changing weather can be full of surprises. So as a precautionary measure, pack at least 1 or 2 cardigans, pullovers or jackets. Not to forget the beanie cap, stole and a light weight blanket.</li>
<li><strong> Club Party Wear:</strong> Finally, depending on your visit, carry a party dress or a more elegant outfit. You might want to go to a nice restaurant for dinner or visit the bar and club that has a dress code, so better be prepared. Women can pack their maxi dress or gown while men could pack a shirt and tie for these occasions.</li>
<li><strong> Footwear:</strong> Most of the trips require two pairs of shoes. Let’s say you need a pair of good sneakers for walking and a pair of flats for going out. Wear the heavier pair, typically sneakers or boots. Pack the lighter pair. They must be flat and light. Think sandals, flats, boat shoes, or flip flops.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Electronic Gadgets</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-71681" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Phone_Laptop_Power-charger_Travel_Checklist.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="468" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Phone_Laptop_Power-charger_Travel_Checklist.jpg 700w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Phone_Laptop_Power-charger_Travel_Checklist-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>These can be put under Essentials because nowadays life seems impossible without them.</p>
<p>1 <strong>Laptop:</strong> If you’re on a business travel, you cannot help without your laptop. It not only gives the ease of checking emails anytime anywhere but it also relaxes you in case you downloaded movies from Netfix and wanted to watch your favourite shows offline.</p>
<p><strong>2 Phone and iPod:</strong> Undoubtedly, phone is one of the most useful and important travel item. Also a day at the beach or pool wouldn’t be perfect without the iPod</p>
<p><strong>3 Camera: </strong>All cities have great spots that need to be photographed. You can prefer to get a small one or if you’re a professional photographer, the more complex cameras can do wonders.</p>
<p><strong>4 Power Charger</strong>: How long does your phone battery last? Not long? Neither does mine, so this is an essential</p>
<p>So now you can make a travel packing list, or just use ours.</p>
<p>Passport? Check. Toothbrush? Check. Moisturizer? So on!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Procedure to get Hajj Visa</h1>
<p>Hajj, the five-day religious pilgrimage to Mecca is a huge and significant event for Muslims across the world. This holy journey to Mecca takes place only once in a year and is mandatory for Muslim adults once in their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Where to Apply for Hajj Visa?</h2>
<p>You can get the visa application form from the nearest <strong>Saudi Consulate</strong>. It is wise to take on a licensed travel agent, who can arrange your visa, travel, accommodation and everything else you might need to perform the Hajj. Your travel agent will send your application form to the <strong>Saudi Consulate</strong>.</p>
<h3>When to Apply for Hajj Visa?</h3>
<p>Each year, Hajj visas are issued from <strong>Mid-Shawwal to 25th Dhual-Qa&#8217;dah</strong>.</p>
<h3>Documents Required to apply for Hajj Visa</h3>
<p>The completed application can be submitted to the HAF to State / UT Haj Committee along with the following documents &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>Passport must be valid for minimum 6 months and should have at least 2 empty visa pages adjoining each other. It should be acceptable both for entry to Saudi Arabia and entry to the next destination.</li>
<li>One recent passport size colour photograph with a white background is required. Full-face view is acceptable. Some travel agents call for 2 colour photos for visa application and group identification card respectively.</li>
<li>Application form filled in with black ink pen or printed should be signed and stamped by the certified travel agency.</li>
<li>The Mahram should write on the application forms complete information on his spouse, children or any relative with whom he is travelling. Birth certificates and copies of marriage must be submitted.</li>
<li>Women need to travel with a Mahram. Proof of kinship has to be submitted. Any female over 45 years old can travel without a Mahram but with any organized group. However, a notarized letter of no objection is required from her Mahram authorizing her to travel with the named group.</li>
<li>The applicant must possess non-refundable roundtrip ticket with confirmed reservations.</li>
<li>For meningitis and ACYW135, proof of vaccination must be submitted. For infants and children up to 15 years of age, vaccination report is mandatory for polio and meningitis. Children above 15 years of age should also present the same. The certificate of vaccination should have been issued not more than 3 years and not less than 10 days prior to entering Saudi Arabia.</li>
<li>Every pilgrim ought to submit 2 certified checks or cashier checks payable to &#8216;Unified Agents Office&#8217; in Jeddah for pilgrimage services that includes transportation costs, guides, Zamzam water agents, tent accommodation in Mina and Arafat. The checks should comprise the name and passport number of the pilgrim along with the date and place of issue. Each applicant must pay the appropriate fees. Pilgrims can submit one check combining both fees. Children between the ages of seven and fifteen should only pay half of the amount. Children below 7 years of age need not pay.</li>

<li>In case the applicant is an Islamic convert, then an Islamic certificate notarized by an Islamic Center must be presented.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Tips To Get Free Upgrades In Flights</strong></h2>
<p>Everyone loves surprises, especially when you are gifted by a flight attendant with a boarding pass with a very low row number, indicating an upgrade. First class upgrades are on most account doled out by a number of metrics, like one handed to the highest-ranking elite flier or the person who cashed in his/her miles. However, there are some hard and soft tactics to get upgraded to first class for free.</p>
<h3>Fly on Holidays</h3>
<p>If you are booking a flight on a bank holiday when business users are less likely to fly, you are likely to be upgraded in order to fill those vacant first class rows.Sometimes, on a full flight when the airlines are forced to upgrade people to accommodate everybody on the flight, your chances are better than your fellow travelers.</p>
<h3>Join Airline’s Loyalty Club</h3>
<p>Even if you are not a frequent traveller, you must become a member of an airline frequent-flyer club. Then you will receive upgrade opportunities. Moreover, if airport staff is looking to upgrade passengers on the day of departure, then they will generally prefer passengers who are frequent flyers of the airline. It is a fact, that passengers who have paid more for their tickets have relatively more chance to be upgraded than passengers who have bought a discounted ticket.</p>
<h3>Check your emails</h3>
<p>Sometimes, airlines send emails on the day of departure offering a cheap (not free) upgrade. So read-through your emails even up to a couple of hours before you fly.</p>
<h3>Check your Seat</h3>
<p>Before taking a seat, make sure your armrests, recliner, seat belt and tray table are in working condition. If they are broken, inform the flight attendant who will reassign a seat &#8211;and it could be to first class.</p>
<h3>Be Early</h3>

<!-- Easy Plugin for AdSense V8.67 -->
<p>Your flight may only have one or two upgrade places available, so maximize your chances of bagging them by rocking up at check-in ten hours before the scheduled departure Sometimes, you can maximize your potential by being hours before the scheduled departure or take the risk of arriving just in time if the flight is overbooked to get a fair chance of an upgrade.</p>
<h3>Dress up</h3>
<p>Remember, an upgrade will put you into the posh cabins, so while an old T-shirt and flip-flops might be comfortable, an airline is less likely to put you in with its top-paying customers if you don&#8217;t look the part. Leave the tracksuit at home and dress as if you’ve just been browsing the FT in the exec lounge – either full-on formal or business casual does the job.</p>
<h3>Special Occasion</h3>
<p>If it is your special occasion like birthday, honeymoon or anniversary, let the cabin crew know. You might get an upgrade, if not then you will surely get a free drink.</p>
<p>There is a lot of ifs and buts when patience and luck is on play, like if there is one vacant first class seat and if you are travelling alone, there is a fair chance.If you have had an inconvenience due the airline, you can politely or be “mad” to ask for an upgrade.  Sometimes a faulty entertainment system or a certain harassment appeal against our neighbor can improve your chances for an upgrade. Sometimes, you can maximize your potentialby being hours before the scheduled departure or take the risk of arriving just in time if the flight is overbooked to get a fair chance of an upgrade. Sometimes, influential travel agents can book their customers into preferred seats and even check for free upgrades.</p>
<p>Try your luck, dress well, be courteous and if you’ve got a genuine reasonsuch as being exceptionally tall, pregnant, or even celebrating a honeymoon, a please, might just do it, you never know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>How to save time at the airport?</h1>
<p>With airports getting busier than ever and queues getting longer at check-in and airport security, the old airport “two-hour” rule often leaves very few minutes enough to buy a magazine, grab a snack or hustle your kids into the bathroom. But air travel does not have to be a hassle. Here are a few time-saving airport tips to make your next trip a breeze.</p>
<h2>1. Choose an Overnight Flight</h2>
<p>An overnight flight may not give you the best night’s slumber, but it can certainly get you through the airport faster. Usually, airports are considerably less crowded at night, so booking a flight after 10 p.m. will help you spend less time in queue and get to your gate faster.</p>
<h2>2. Route to Airport</h2>
<p>It is important to know beforehand where the airport is and what the shortest route to reach the airport is. If you are using public transport, make sure you check an up-to-date timetable in advance and in case you’re making your own way there, then use Google Maps route planner to get a better idea of how long it might take to reach there.</p>
<h2>3. Download The Airline App and Check Flight Status</h2>
<p>Most reputed airlines have native Apps for iOS and Samsung. These generally feature check-in and booking information, flight trackers and travel tips. If you download the airline app to your phone, you can save time by getting live updates instead of waiting at the help desk. In other words, when your plane is ready, you’re ready! Generally most of the airlines text their flight status updates if you sign up on their websites, and sites smartphone apps.</p>
<h2>4. Prepare Your Documents</h2>
<p>Before getting in the check-in line, keep in hand all the documents and items that need to be checked. This will save your time and make the process hassle free</p>
<h2>5. Screenshot of Ticket</h2>
<p>Another time saving option is to go paperless by carrying your e-ticket on your phone. Get a screenshot of the ticket. It is much easier to find it in the phone gallery than on email or airline’s app.</p>
<h2>6. Print your Boarding Pass</h2>

     data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
<script>

</script></div>
<!-- Easy Plugin for AdSense V8.67 -->
<p>Taking a print out of your boarding pass is commendable. There are chances of your mobile running out of battery unless you’re carrying a charger. So a paper back up can sometimes be a life-saver!</p>
<h2>7. Packing Smart</h2>
<p>Pack carry-on bags in layers. Any item you might need to remove during check-in and security should be easily accessible. Tuck all your valuables such as jewellery, cash and laptop in carry-on bag, rather than in checked luggage. Keeping in mind the 3-1-1 liquids rule, keep all liquids such as gels, creams and paste in a quart-sized, zip-lock bag. Moreover, keep your boarding pass and ID in a jacket pocket or in the outer pocket of your bag, since you will be using them often in the airport.</p>
<h2>8. Weigh Heavy Bags At Home</h2>
<p>If you’re embarking on a lengthy journey and travelling with really heavy luggage, then you must weigh your luggage in advance. This will save some time at the airport. Also ensure that your bags do not exceed the airline’s weight limit for checked luggage so that you do not have to repack your bags when you arrive at the airport.</p>
<h2>9. Smart Airport Wear</h2>
<p>Getting through airport security faster also means dressing smart. Items containing metal like jewellery, earrings, rings, watches and belts should be stored in a secure spot before reaching the checkpoint. Store your coats and jackets in checked baggage before screening. Wear slip on shoes for quick removal and a more efficient process through the security lines.</p>
<h2>10. Sign Up for TSA Pre-Check</h2>
<p>Sign up for TSA pre-check to speed up the security screening process. Qualified travellers get their own special line which is always much shorter than the general security line. You neither have to take off shoes nor remove liquid or laptop from your bag.</p>
<h2>11. The Classic – Check In Online</h2>
<p>Checking in online saves ample time that would have been spent on queuing at the flight desk. It is much quicker for those without hold luggage, as they can walk straight through with their printed boarding pass or mobile token.</p>
<h2>12. Bookmark Terminal Maps</h2>
<p>Airports are quite big and it is much easy to get lost. Most big airports have prepared terminal maps to help travellers. By bookmarking terminal maps, you can easily locate terminal gates and save time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>6 Handy tips to pack your things while flying</h2>
<p>When you are travelling, you want to have a peaceful ride and not burdened with over-weight and over-stuffed luggage. It is but natural to wish all your favorite clothes and rightly paired shoes as part of your travel itinerary. You need planning to decide your wardrobe according to the climate of the place, the purpose of your visit and of course the comfort factor. It is advised to carry outfits that are light and can be washed and dried easily. If you pre-plan out each outfit for each day/event, you will save yourself from over packing.  Once your choices are ready, the next important work is to pack your luggage diligently, in order to keep it light and organised. Here are some professional packing techniques that can make all the difference.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Know Baggage Fee Policy</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While some airlines permit travellers to check at least one bag on international flights, most of the U.S. carriers charge heavy for luggage checked on domestic flights. Thereby, it is important to figure out the baggage fee policy of your airline. Also make sure you understand the hand luggage allowance and avoid costly charges at the gate. It is recommended to go through the hand luggage guide too.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Use Plastic Bags to organise</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Plastic bags are transparent and the best way to organise your laundry items. Use ziplocks for carrying liquids like shampoos, plastic cubes for accessories, jewelleries and cosmetics. Use plastic wraps for your undergarments, they not only save space but also your time when you are looking for them. The plastic bags can also be used to compartmentalize your luggage. Compression sacks are heavy-duty plastic bags with a one-way valve for squeezing air out. They can be used for packing clothes, to vacuum-seal the bag to get a flatter and smaller package. Keep empty bags handy for soiled clothes, shoes and for any emergency usage.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Become a Roller</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Roll your garments, this not only saves space but also keeps it wrinkle-free. Keep the heavier garments at the bottom of your suitcase while the lighter ones can come on top, for example, the shoes can be placed near the wheel, at the base. This will make it easy to roll your luggage. However, when it come to carrying heavy clothes, it is always prudent to wear them on flight instead of packing them like a heavy pullover.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Pack Dual-Purpose Garments</h2>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Garments that are two-in-one are best suited for air travel. Trousers that turn into shorts or jacket that turns into a pillow not only save space but are also effective in reducing weight of the luggage.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Pack Gadgets in Ziplock Bags</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Organise all of your electronics goods like phone charger, camera charger, adaptors, headphones and cables in ziplock bags. They are easy to bring forward in security check.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2>Keep Medical kit Handy</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to organize your medicine kit so you are prepared for any emergency. The aeroplane kit should have an eye mask, blow-up neck pillow, more earplugs, pillows, basically anything you might need to make yourself comfortable.</p>
<p>A good tip while packing is to stick to basics. Less is more, this is of the simplest but often overlooked packing tips.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Tips for travelling with elders in a flight</h1>
<p>Is air travel safe for the elderly? What will happen if there’s a medical emergency during the flight? No doubt that travelling with elders is a bit different from a normal family vacation, but before you start to ponder and make a decision, check out our useful air travel tips for elders that can make the flight as smooth as possible.</p>
<h2>1. Pre-flight Planning</h2>
<p>For a safe and easy travel, ensure that your luggage is light before you leave for the airport. Make sure you check all luggages before boarding the flight. This will reduce time and hassle in security check in the airport. Wear loose and comfortable clothing. Slip on shoes is much preferred.</p>
<h2>2. Discounted Airfare</h2>
<p>With increasing age comes some benefits as discounts. Discounted airfare is seldom available to senior travellers, so it is worth inquiring the airline of available discounts. However, you must book reservation with the airline directly to avail the facility as discounts may not be eligible through travel agents or third parties.</p>
<h2>3. Print and Share Your Travel Documents</h2>
<p>Print and keep your travel documents handy. Make a copy of your itinerary and send it to those you are visiting. This will help them know when your plane is arriving and can make necessary arrangements if it is delayed. Remember to leave a copy with a friend or family member back home. Apart from this, carry copies of your passport ID, visas, travel insurance, emergency contacts, and medical information along with you. In case your flight is cancelled, your passport is stolen, or your prescriptions are lost, you can call your travel insurance company for help.</p>
<h2>4. Airplane Boarding Assistance</h2>
<p>Seniors who require special assistance can board before other travellers through priority boarding. Perhaps, they can also request escort help from airport staff to help get them to their seat.</p>
<h2>5.  Select an Aisle Seat on Long Flights</h2>
<p>If the flight is long, choose an aisle seat that allows for easy access to the bathroom and allows you to stretch and move about during the flight. The freedom to move about or mobility is less restricted from an aisle seat. In case you are travelling with another person, you can choose seats that are across the aisle from each other that enables you to be nearby.</p>
<h2>6. Airplane Travel Aids</h2>

<!-- Easy Plugin for AdSense V8.67 -->
<p>Travel aid items such as noise-reduction headphones and travel pillows can help create a more restful environment, mainly on long flights. Keep compression stockings in a carry-on and wear them after boarding to reduce the risk of blood clots. Not to forget a mask or nose-and-mouth guard to wear in-flight in order to reduce exposure to infectious airborne bacteria.</p>
<h2>7. Keep Healthy Snacks</h2>
<p>Do not keep yourself famished in anticipation of unexpected delays – keep some healthy snacks like nuts, sliced fruits and energy bars. This is essential if you are on medication or you need to manage chronic health issues like Diabetes. You can also go through the in-flight meal schedule before boarding and get prepared accordingly.</p>
<h2>8. Skip Alcohol and Stay Hydrated</h2>
<p>Flying at high altitudes can sometimes lead to dehydration. Unfortunately, this becomes a serious problem for many seniors. In order to avoid this, carry a water bottle with you and fill it at one of the airport cafes after you pass through security. Keep sipping water all throughout your flight.</p>
<h2>9.Keep Medicines Handy</h2>
<p>Senior travelers must keep their important medications handy and that too in ample quantity, in case of unexpected delays. However, you can prepare an in-flight medication schedule, mainly if crossing multiple time zones, to assure the right medicines are taken at the right times.</p>
<h2>10. Ask Crew Members for Help</h2>
<p>With so many crew members available to help passengers, you should not be afraid to ask for help lifting your bag into place, or for getting a cup of water. Flying at 30,000 feet or even more through the skies is quite hard on the human body and you might be far more tired than you ever thought. So, take it easy and get help with your luggage<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Following these simple steps can certainly make air travel less tiring and complicated. After all, flying must be a rewarding experience for the elderly to see the world or to visit long-distance family members or friends, rather than be a headache for one and all involved.</p>
