										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Procedure to get Hajj Visa</h1>
<p>Hajj, the five-day religious pilgrimage to Mecca is a huge and significant event for Muslims across the world. This holy journey to Mecca takes place only once in a year and is mandatory for Muslim adults once in their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Where to Apply for Hajj Visa?</h2>
<p>You can get the visa application form from the nearest <strong>Saudi Consulate</strong>. It is wise to take on a licensed travel agent, who can arrange your visa, travel, accommodation and everything else you might need to perform the Hajj. Your travel agent will send your application form to the <strong>Saudi Consulate</strong>.</p>
<h3>When to Apply for Hajj Visa?</h3>
<p>Each year, Hajj visas are issued from <strong>Mid-Shawwal to 25th Dhual-Qa&#8217;dah</strong>.</p>
<h3>Documents Required to apply for Hajj Visa</h3>
<p>The completed application can be submitted to the HAF to State / UT Haj Committee along with the following documents &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>Passport must be valid for minimum 6 months and should have at least 2 empty visa pages adjoining each other. It should be acceptable both for entry to Saudi Arabia and entry to the next destination.</li>
<li>One recent passport size colour photograph with a white background is required. Full-face view is acceptable. Some travel agents call for 2 colour photos for visa application and group identification card respectively.</li>
<li>Application form filled in with black ink pen or printed should be signed and stamped by the certified travel agency.</li>
<li>The Mahram should write on the application forms complete information on his spouse, children or any relative with whom he is travelling. Birth certificates and copies of marriage must be submitted.</li>
<li>Women need to travel with a Mahram. Proof of kinship has to be submitted. Any female over 45 years old can travel without a Mahram but with any organized group. However, a notarized letter of no objection is required from her Mahram authorizing her to travel with the named group.</li>
<li>The applicant must possess non-refundable roundtrip ticket with confirmed reservations.</li>
<li>For meningitis and ACYW135, proof of vaccination must be submitted. For infants and children up to 15 years of age, vaccination report is mandatory for polio and meningitis. Children above 15 years of age should also present the same. The certificate of vaccination should have been issued not more than 3 years and not less than 10 days prior to entering Saudi Arabia.</li>
<li>Every pilgrim ought to submit 2 certified checks or cashier checks payable to &#8216;Unified Agents Office&#8217; in Jeddah for pilgrimage services that includes transportation costs, guides, Zamzam water agents, tent accommodation in Mina and Arafat. The checks should comprise the name and passport number of the pilgrim along with the date and place of issue. Each applicant must pay the appropriate fees. Pilgrims can submit one check combining both fees. Children between the ages of seven and fifteen should only pay half of the amount. Children below 7 years of age need not pay.</li>
<li>Minors are granted a <strong>Hajj visa</strong> only when they are accompanied by family. Minors travelling one parent must submit a notarized letter of authorization, in either in Arabic or English, signed by either parents or legal guardians.</li>
<li>In case the applicant is an Islamic convert, then an Islamic certificate notarized by an Islamic Center must be presented.</li>
