<p>No matter how much you pay for your seat, how much is your leg room or whether you’re flying first class or not, the one and only thing that many air travelers have in common is ear pain. While most ear discomfort on a flight travel is nothing more than an annoyance, what happens if it becomes more serious? Ear pain and pressure can lead to severe pain and in rare cases, hearing loss. So it’s wise to take precautions before, during and also after your flight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Ear Pain on Flight Travel</strong></p>
<p>The joy of flying is often accompanied with ear discomfort. Popularly called the ‘airplane ear’, it’s felt as prickling of the ears with slight pain. It usually happens during landing; precisely, after the pilot announces that the airplane has begun its descent. As the plane starts to land, the changes in air pressure pushes your eardrums in resulting in pain. Most of the times, you feel that your ears are blocked. While the ear tubes try to adapt to the change in atmospheric pressure, this odd sensation in the ears might become more painful for a few travelers.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-71752  aligncenter" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="330" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas.jpg 810w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas-300x167.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /></p>
<p><strong>Quick Remedies for Relief from Earn Pain</strong></p>
<p>Simply waiting for that ear discomfort to fade out will certainly not work wonders. So, here are some safe and natural methods that will quickly give you a sigh of relief.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chew Candies</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-71750 alignleft" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Candies-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Candies-300x200.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Candies.jpg 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />It’s the sweetest remedy that really works! Even if you don’t have a sweet tooth, pick some candies offered by the cabin crew before takeoff and landing. Chewing and sucking candies enables continuous movement of the jaws. It allows the air pressure in your ear to balance out by opening the Eustachian tubes.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>The Valsalva Maneuver</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This breathing technique may sound complicated, but it’s much simple and easy to do! Take a deep breath first; then close your mouth and pinch your nose. While the mouth is closed, try to blow air gently through the nostrils till you hear a popping sound. The maneuver equalizes the air pressure in your ears. However, if you have severe cold or you’re prone to allergies, avoid the Valsalva as it may lead to severe ear infection.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>The Toynbee Maneuver</strong></li>
</ol>

<div class="ezAdsense adsense adsense-midtext" style="text-align:left;margin:12px;"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

<p>Another ear-popping method to relieve ear pain! Much alike the Valsalva, it is an effective ear-clearing technique that you can do right in your seat. The Toynbee technique involves pinching your nose gently, sipping on some water and swallowing it hard simultaneously. For better results, repeat both the maneuvers back to back till your ears are clear.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Yawning</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71751 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yawning.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="638" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yawning.jpg 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yawning-300x199.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yawning-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p>Yawning needs no rocket science. Even if you’re not sleepy try to yawn as much as you can! The wide stretching of the mouth makes the muscles active causing opening and closing of the Eustachian tubes. This balances the air pressure outside. Repeat every few minutes until your ears pop.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Pop your ears</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You must have tried this child’s play, years back. Time to regain! Pinch your nose closing it with your fingers and then blow through your nose until you feel your ears &#8216;pop’. Popping ears are effective in opening the ear tubes and regulating the air pressure in the ears.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Nasal Spray and Decongestant</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another quick relief is to use nasal spray, just an hour prior to landing and only as-needed. It will offset any swelling that might arise in the nose, hindering the air flow in the Eustachian tubes. Do not overuse nasal sprays as this may cause more congestion. Though decongestant is not a complete cure, it’s certainly an immediate relief before landing.</p>
<p><strong>Tips to Prevent Ear Pain</strong></p>
<p>As the ancient saying relates, prevention is better than cure! Below given are some expert tips that you can follow to avoid that painful episode of plugged ears.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wake up an hour before landing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This will give ample time to your ears to adjust to the change in air pressure while landing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Opt for Ear Plugs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Often called ear planes, these soft silicone earplugs are very helpful to regulate the air pressure and reduce the chances of pain caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction. Insert in your ears during takeoff and landings.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Suck on a boiled sweet</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re travelling with kids, you can give them some boiled sweets before landing. It actually works. Chewing and swallowing enables the air to flow up the Eustachian tube.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make sure you’re well enough to fly</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any ear, nose or sinus infection, avoid flying. The swelling can cause bleeding, pain or a perforated ear drum. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about decongestants to help reduce the swelling in your ears. Also check with your Physician before flying if you’ve recently had any type of ear surgery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Things You Should Check if You Have Deep Vein Thrombosis Risk</strong></p>
<p>Every year, more than 300 million people travel on long-distance flights lasting for more than four hours. For them, blood clots, also called DVT or Deep Vein Thrombosis could be a serious risk. Blood clots can form in the deep veins of your legs during travel because you’ve been sitting still in a confined space for longer period of time. The longer you’re immobile, the greater is your risk of DVT. Here is a complete round-up of DVT that will help you to recognize the symptoms and check if you have Deep Vein Thrombosis risk.</p>
<h2><strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis or (DVT) </strong></h2>
<p>When a blood clot is formed in one of the deep veins of the body, it’s called deep vein thrombosis or DVT. It appears as a swelling and is much painful. If the blood clot breaks free, it can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream. In rare cases, it can also cut off blood flow to the lungs. The biggest danger of DVT is that part of the clot could break off and travel to your lungs causing a blockage known as a pulmonary embolism or PE.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71736 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel.jpg" alt="" width="803" height="448" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel.jpg 803w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel-300x167.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></p>
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Causes of</strong> <strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis</strong></h3>
<p>Blood is meant for flowing in the veins. If it becomes stagnant, there is a potential for blood to clot. It constantly forms microscopic clots in the veins that are frequently broken down by the body. If the balance of clot formation and clot breakdown changes, this may lead to significant clotting and formation of thrombus.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Immobility</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Prolonged sitting and travel like long airplane flights, car, or train travel</li>
<li>Hospitalization</li>
<li>Surgery</li>
<li>Without surgery and casting, trauma to the lower leg</li>
<li>Pregnancy, especially after delivery of the baby</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Coagulation of the blood faster than usual (hypercoagulation)</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Medications such as birth control pillsand other estrogens</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Genetic or hereditary predisposition to clot formation</li>
<li>Polycythemia or increased number of red blood cells</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Trauma to the vein</li>
<li>Bruised leg or arm</li>
<li>Fracture to the leg or arm</li>
<li>Complication of an invasive procedure of the vein</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Symptoms of </strong><strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) </strong></h3>
<p>Symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis gradually appear when blood clots in one of the deep veins. Generally, it occurs in any vein of the leg, but it can be found in other locations too like the pelvis. However, the most serious complication of DVT is pulmonary embolism where a blood clot breaks off of the DVT and travels through the blood and clogs in a blood vessel of the lung. Symptoms observed in the overlying skin and include swelling, pain, cramping, soreness, discoloration or even a feeling of warmth in your affected leg. The affected vein can sometimes be felt as a rough thick cord beneath the skin. Symptoms of DVT are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Redness or discolored skin on the leg.</li>
<li>Warmth</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
<li>Tenderness</li>
<li>Leg Pain</li>
<li>Lump beneath the skin</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Risk of Getting Deep Vein Thrombosis</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71735 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Age-above-40.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Age-above-40.jpg 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Age-above-40-300x200.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Age-above-40-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p>For many physicians, DVT is quite tough to detect. That’s why it’s always better to know what puts you at risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis so you can avoid getting it. Here are a few important things that increase your chances of DVT:</p>
<p><strong>1)You had a blood clot</strong> <strong>before</strong></p>
<p>It has been observed that nearly 30% of people who had DVT are bound to have it again.</p>
<p><strong>2) You have a family history of it</strong></p>
<p>If your parent or any sibling had DVT, you’re more at a risk of getting it. If both your parents have been diagnosed, your chances will be even higher.</p>
<p><strong>3) You’re over age 40</strong></p>
<p>Odds of getting DVT, grows with age.</p>

<p><strong>4) You’re on bed rest or sit for long periods of time</strong></p>
<p>The deep veins running in the centre of your legs depend on the leg muscles to force blood back to your lungs and heart. If your leg muscles don’t move for a while, blood starts to pool in your lower legs. This is more perceptive for a clot to form.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71737 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pregnant-Women.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pregnant-Women.jpg 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pregnant-Women-300x200.jpg 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pregnant-Women-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p><strong>5) You’re pregnant or just gave birth</strong></p>
<p>If you’re expecting a baby, biologically, your levels of the hormone estrogens will rise. This causes the blood to clot more easily. On the other hand, if you take birth control pills or some sort of hormone replacement therapy, your chances of DVT also goes up. That’s because most of these drugs contain estrogen.</p>
<p><strong>6) Your blood doesn’t clot like it should</strong></p>
<p>A few people are born with a blood clotting disorder. This causes your blood to be thicker than normal when it circulates through your body.</p>
<p><strong>7) You need to lose weight</strong></p>
<p>The greater your body mass index (BMI), the higher your risk for DVT will be. BMI measures how much fat you have compared to your weight and height.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71738 size-full" src="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Over-Weight.png" alt="" width="960" height="637" srcset="https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Over-Weight.png 960w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Over-Weight-300x199.png 300w, https://airlines-airports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Over-Weight-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p><strong>8) You have other health issues</strong></p>
<p>Those with heart disease, lung disease and inflammatory bowel disease are more likely to get DVT. Also those with cancer or are going through cancer treatment are prone to DVT..</p>
<p><strong>9) Your vein has been injured</strong></p>
<p>If you have badly hurt your muscle or fractured your bone, the inner lining of a nearby vein might have been damaged. This may lead to a clot. Major surgeries in stomach, leg, pelvis, hip also makes you more prone to DVT.</p>
