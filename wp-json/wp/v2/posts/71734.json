For them, blood clots, also called DVT or Deep Vein Thrombosis could be a serious risk. Blood clots can form in the deep veins of your legs during travel because you\u2019ve been sitting still in a confined space for longer period of time. The longer you\u2019re immobile, the greater is your risk of DVT. Here is a complete round-up of DVT that will help you to recognize the symptoms and check if you have Deep Vein Thrombosis risk.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis or (DVT)\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When a\u00a0blood clot\u00a0is formed in one of the deep veins of the body, it\u2019s called\u00a0deep vein thrombosis or DVT. It appears as a swelling and is much painful. If the blood clot breaks free, it can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream. In rare cases, it can also cut off\u00a0blood\u00a0flow to the\u00a0lungs. The biggest danger of DVT is that part of the clot could break off and travel to your\u00a0lungs causing a blockage known as a\u00a0pulmonary embolism or PE.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-71736 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"803\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel.jpg 803w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel-300x167.jpg 300w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Am-at-Risk-of-DVT-Quick-Checklist-for-Flight-Travel-768x428.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Causes of<\/strong> <strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Blood is meant for flowing in the veins. If it becomes stagnant, there is a potential for blood to clot. It constantly forms microscopic clots in the veins that are frequently broken down by the body. If the balance of clot formation and clot breakdown changes, this may lead to significant clotting and formation of thrombus.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Immobility<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Prolonged sitting and travel like long airplane flights, car, or train travel<\/li>\n<li>Hospitalization<\/li>\n<li>Surgery<\/li>\n<li>Without surgery and casting, trauma to the lower leg<\/li>\n<li>Pregnancy, especially after delivery of the baby<\/li>\n<li>Obesity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Coagulation of the blood faster than usual (hypercoagulation)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Medications such as\u00a0birth control pillsand other\u00a0estrogens<\/li>\n<li>Smoking<\/li>\n<li>Genetic or hereditary predisposition to clot formation<\/li>\n<li>Polycythemia or increased number of red blood cells<\/li>\n<li>Cancer<\/li>\n<li>Trauma to the vein<\/li>\n<li>Bruised leg or arm<\/li>\n<li>Fracture to the leg or arm<\/li>\n<li>Complication of an invasive procedure of the vein<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Symptoms of <\/strong><strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis gradually appear when blood clots\u00a0in one of the deep veins. Generally, it\u00a0occurs in any vein of the leg, but it can be found in other locations too like the pelvis. However, the most serious complication of\u00a0DVT\u00a0is\u00a0pulmonary embolism where a\u00a0blood clot\u00a0breaks off of the\u00a0DVT\u00a0and travels through the blood and clogs in a blood vessel of the lung. Symptoms observed in the overlying skin and include swelling, pain,\u00a0cramping, soreness, discoloration or even a feeling of warmth in your affected leg. The affected vein can sometimes be felt as a rough thick cord beneath the skin. Symptoms of DVT are listed below.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Redness or discolored skin on the leg.<\/li>\n<li>Warmth<\/li>\n<li>Swelling<\/li>\n<li>Tenderness<\/li>\n<li>Leg Pain<\/li>\n<li>Lump beneath the skin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Risk of Getting Deep Vein Thrombosis<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-71735 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Age-above-40.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Age-above-40.jpg 960w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Age-above-40-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Age-above-40-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For many physicians, DVT is quite tough to detect. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always better to know what puts you at risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis so you can avoid getting it. Here are a few important things that increase your chances of DVT:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1)You had a blood clot<\/strong> <strong>before<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It has been observed that nearly 30% of people who had DVT are bound to have it again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) You have a family history of it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If your parent or any sibling had DVT, you\u2019re more at a risk of getting it. If both your parents have been diagnosed, your chances will be even higher.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) You\u2019re over age 40<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Odds of getting DVT, grows with age.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) You\u2019re on\u00a0bed rest\u00a0or sit for long periods of time<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The deep veins running in the centre of your legs depend on the leg muscles to force\u00a0blood\u00a0back to your\u00a0lungs\u00a0and\u00a0heart. If your leg muscles don\u2019t move for a while, blood starts to pool in your lower legs. This is more perceptive for a clot to form.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-71737 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Pregnant-Women.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Pregnant-Women.jpg 960w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Pregnant-Women-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Pregnant-Women-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>5) You\u2019re\u00a0pregnant\u00a0or just gave birth<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re expecting a baby, biologically, your levels of the hormone\u00a0estrogens\u00a0will rise. This causes the blood to clot more easily. On the other hand, if you take\u00a0birth control pills\u00a0or\u00a0some sort of hormone replacement therapy, your chances of DVT also goes up. That\u2019s because most of these\u00a0drugs\u00a0contain estrogen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6) Your blood doesn\u2019t clot like it should<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A few people are born with a blood clotting disorder. This causes your blood to be thicker than normal when it circulates through your body.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7) You need to\u00a0lose weight<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The greater your\u00a0body mass index\u00a0(BMI), the higher your risk for DVT will be. BMI measures how much\u00a0fat\u00a0you have compared to your weight and height.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-71738 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Over-Weight.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"637\" srcset=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Over-Weight.png 960w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Over-Weight-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Over-Weight-768x510.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>8) You have other health issues<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Those with\u00a0heart disease,\u00a0lung disease and\u00a0inflammatory bowel disease\u00a0are more likely to get DVT.
