While most ear discomfort on a flight travel is nothing more than an annoyance,\u00a0what happens if it\u00a0becomes more serious? Ear pain and pressure can lead to severe pain and\u00a0in rare cases, hearing loss. So it\u2019s wise to take precautions before, during\u00a0and also after your flight.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Causes of Ear Pain on Flight Travel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The joy of flying is often accompanied with ear discomfort. Popularly called the \u2018airplane ear\u2019, it\u2019s felt as prickling of the ears with slight pain. It usually happens during landing; precisely, after the pilot announces that the airplane has begun its descent. As the plane starts to land, the changes in air pressure pushes your eardrums in resulting in pain. Most of the times, you feel that your ears are blocked. While the ear tubes try to adapt to the change in atmospheric pressure, this odd sensation in the ears might become more painful for a few travelers.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-71752  aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"594\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas.jpg 810w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas-300x167.jpg 300w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Ear-pain-during-flight-travel-prevention-tips-and-relief-ideas-768x427.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Quick Remedies for Relief from Earn Pain<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Simply waiting for that ear discomfort to fade out will certainly not work wonders. So, here are some safe and natural methods that will quickly give you a sigh of relief.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Chew Candies<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-71750 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Candies-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Candies-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Candies.jpg 510w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>It\u2019s the sweetest remedy that really works! Even if you don\u2019t have a sweet tooth, pick some candies offered by the cabin crew before takeoff and landing. Chewing and sucking candies enables continuous movement of the jaws. It allows the air pressure in your ear to balance out by opening the Eustachian tubes.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>The Valsalva Maneuver<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This breathing technique may sound complicated, but it\u2019s much simple and easy to do! Take a deep breath first; then close your mouth and pinch your nose. While the mouth is closed, try to blow air gently through the nostrils till you hear a popping sound. The maneuver equalizes the air pressure in your ears. However, if you have severe cold or you\u2019re prone to allergies, avoid the Valsalva as it may lead to severe ear infection.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>The Toynbee Maneuver<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Another ear-popping method to relieve ear pain! Much alike the Valsalva, it is an effective ear-clearing technique that you can do right in your seat. The Toynbee technique involves pinching your nose gently, sipping on some water and swallowing it hard simultaneously. For better results, repeat both the maneuvers back to back till your ears are clear.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Yawning<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-71751 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/yawning.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"638\" srcset=\"https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/yawning.jpg 960w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/yawning-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/airlines-airports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/yawning-768x510.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yawning needs no rocket science. Even if you\u2019re not sleepy try to yawn as much as you can! The wide stretching of the mouth makes the muscles active causing opening and closing of the Eustachian tubes. This balances the air pressure outside. Repeat every few minutes until your ears pop.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Pop your ears<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You must have tried this child\u2019s play, years back. Time to regain! Pinch your nose closing it with your fingers and then blow through your nose until you feel your ears &#8216;pop\u2019. Popping ears are effective in opening the ear tubes and regulating the air pressure in the ears.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Nasal Spray and Decongestant<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Another quick relief is to use nasal spray, just an hour prior to landing and only as-needed. It will offset any swelling that might arise in the nose, hindering the air flow in the Eustachian tubes. Do not overuse\u00a0nasal sprays\u00a0as this may\u00a0cause more congestion.\u00a0Though decongestant is not a complete cure, it\u2019s certainly an immediate relief before\u00a0landing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tips to Prevent Ear Pain<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As the ancient saying relates, prevention is better than cure! Below given are some expert tips that you can follow to avoid that painful episode of plugged ears.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Wake up an hour before landing<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This will give ample time to your ears to adjust to the change in air pressure while landing.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Opt for Ear Plugs<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Often called ear planes, these soft silicone earplugs are very helpful to regulate the air pressure and reduce the chances of pain caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction. Insert in your ears during takeoff and landings.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Suck on a boiled sweet<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you\u2019re travelling with kids, you can give them some boiled sweets before landing. It actually works. Chewing and swallowing enables the air to flow up the Eustachian tube.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Make sure you\u2019re well enough to fly<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you have any ear, nose or sinus infection, avoid flying. The swelling can cause bleeding, pain or a perforated ear drum. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about decongestants to help reduce the swelling in your ears. Also check with your Physician before flying if you\u2019ve recently had any type of ear surgery.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No matter how much you pay for your seat, how much is your leg room or whether you\u2019re flying first class or not, the one and only thing that many air travelers have in common is ear pain.
