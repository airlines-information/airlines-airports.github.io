After 14 weeks, it may be difficult to stay seated for a long time, but you may not be too nauseated\u00a0and will have some energy back.<\/p>\n<p>Between 14 weeks\u00a0 to 28 weeks, becomes the best time for travelling, however, it is always wise to listen to your body and keep the doctor informed so that he\/she can make a risk assessment for you. Here are some safety tips for pregnant women.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Convey your Status<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Inform the flight attendant about your pregnancy and keep your medical documents and medicines handy. The doctor\u2019s report will help the flight attendants in the event of an emergency. In fact, print out two copies. Keep one copy with you and give the other one to your travelling companion. They are responsible for your health and your baby\u2019s safety.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Book the Aisle Seat<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Pregnant ladies need to use the bathroom frequently, so an aisle seat will help you get out of your seat easier. This will also help, when you take small walks to make yourself comfortable and increase blood circulation. Having a seat towards the front of the plane or in the last row near the exit can also make the boarding and un-boarding process a little faster. You can also opt for a\u00a0bulkhead seat\u00a0for more legroom.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Comfortable Maternity Dress<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As body temperature tends to fluctuate in pregnancy, it is advisable to dress in loose layers. Some of the smart options are jumpsuits, Maxi dresses, long sweaters and dusters. Wear comfortable shoes and slippers that can be removed easily in case feet swell owing to cabin pressure. Not to forget the effective compression socks.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Stay Hydrated<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated.\u00a0 Avoid caffeine, which can dehydrate you. Turbulence can cause motion sickness like nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sweating and a general feeling of unease.\u00a0Medicines like Dramamine are very effective, sip on sparkling water or ginger ale or try some ginger candies which can help settle your stomach. It is always a good idea to check the seat-back pocket for a sick bag before takeoff.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Pack Healthy Snacks<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Do not rely on airplane snacks to get you through! Carry some healthy, filling options that are handy and you can consume when hunger strikes. Nutritionists recommend veggies, hard-boiled eggs, almonds, and almond butter. A small pack of protein powder can also be carried.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Prepare for Nausea<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Though you may not be suffering from morning sickness, turbulence can still be a major cause for nausea. You can sip on sparkling water or any mint tea. Ginger candies or supplements can also help settle your stomach.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Walk the Aisle<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Walk up and down the aisle to avoid leg cramps and keep your blood circulating efficiently. You can also do some simple leg lifts and stretches by holding seatbacks or overhead bins. This will help maintain proper body balance. Make sure that there is no turbulence while doing exercises.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is not easy to fly during pregnancy but with appropriate planning you can have a safe and comfortable trip.
