					<description><![CDATA[So disappointed. Booked a flight from Changchun to Johannesburg and asked the sales lady in Johannesburg sales office about extra buggage. She gave me a figure of 1700 yuan for the whole trip. Now my wife was an extra 2100 yuan for local flights despite being assured she will pay once in Changchun for the whole trip. Should have used other airlines who are honest and no hidden costs]]></description>
