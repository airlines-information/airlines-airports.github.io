					<description><![CDATA[I am writing to you about an experience that occurred on Friday March 19 on flight 5712. I was seating in seat 5 A. Delta had told me when I made the reservation that this row was reserved for disabilities and it was safe to assume that I would not have anybody sitting next to me. I have a disability with my eyes. I am 75 years old. When the plane had finished boarding, a man boarded who had the seat next to me. I said that I had been told by Delta that I would not be sitting right next to somebody. I said that I did not want to sit next to somebody, that I had pretty much isolated for the past year. I had my second shot. But the time frame was not complete.. The gate agent came on board and came in my face. I said don&#039;t come in my face and I raised my hand and most likely grazed her arm. She yelled out with drama don&#039;t touch me snd called the supervisor who came on the plane and told me to get up and take my things. After the fact I learned that she claimed that I hit her. Well the supervisor said that it was up to the pilot to say if I could stay on the plane. He bullied me
 I stood by the cockpit and he asked the flight attendants if They thought I should stay on the plane.He almost made me get down on my hands and knees to beg him. He told me to apologize to the gate agent. He told me that if I did not behave he would call the police in Raleigh. He said lets see if you behave yourself.I have been a teacher in the inner city for over 40 years. It was the most horrible degrading experience. I am still suffering the aftereffects with nightmares and more eye problems from stress. If I as a teacher had bullied another  teacher I would be suspended. I think that this pilot needs a retraining or some kind of punishment.
 I am what you might consider elderly and I was petrified. No one should be treated like he treated me. Now Delta is determining whether I will be banned from flyinng with them. I have flown with Delta for over 30 years. This started with my fear of sitting next to someone and the gate attendant lying.  I have flown all over the world and have never felt so degraded from a pilot&#039;s treatment.]]></description>
