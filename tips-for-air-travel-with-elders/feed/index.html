					<description><![CDATA[I booked a flight from San Francisco to Frankfurt for tomorrow April 27, 2020. As this flight was cancelled, I am requested to book a new flight on a future date. I am 81 years old and don&#039;t know if I will be still able to travel on a future date to book a new flight. For this reason I am requesting Lufthansa to reimburse me for my ticket. If I should be able to fly on a later date, I surely will book a new flight and enjoy my trip.]]></description>
