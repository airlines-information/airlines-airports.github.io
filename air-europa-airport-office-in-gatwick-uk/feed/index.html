					<description><![CDATA[Hi, 

I travelled with AE from LGW via MAD to ASU. My luggage has not arrived. I have submitted a lost luggage report which has the ID ASUUX11345.

However, I want to make sure that AE air searching the LGW system as well as the Madrid system for my luggage. Given how chaotic LGW was on Monday when I departed I don&#039;t have full confidence that will be done unless I explicitly ask for it to be done.

Could someone contact me to confirm that my luggage (x2) made it onto the LGW to Madrid flight? That will help us narrow down where my luggage is.]]></description>
