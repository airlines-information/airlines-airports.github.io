					<description><![CDATA[I need assistance regarding a refund for which I received email  confirmation in August 2020 that I would received, but NEVER HAPPENED.  I have called many, many, many times.   Between August - November, the response from Customer Service was &quot;It takes up to 90 days for the refund to hit your account.&quot;   As of November through today, the response is &quot;it&#039;s been escalated.&quot;  I am not allowed to speak to manager/supervisor or the Finance department to whom my issues has been escalated.     I contacted Customer Relations twice.  The first time they directed me back to customer service.  The second time they didn&#039;t even reply.   This is THEFT by Alitalia. I am disgusted by this airline with the lack of accountability, inability to reach supervisors or other departments and the lies they have customer support provided to customers who spend thousands of dollars.  As an Italian, this is a disgrace to Italy. As a customer, this is poor treatment of the individuals who keep this airlines funded.  I demand someone contact me immediately as it has now been 7 months of a runaround.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alitalia has refused to refund tickets that were not properly issued despite the fact I immediately called the company upon receipt of the confirmation e mail and advised them of the error.  I am over 90% sure the error was not on my side as I was looking at a specific date in June when I made the reservation.  The confirmation had the same date, but in July.  I made numerous attempts to contact Alitalia and have them refund the ticket as I purchased a ticket for the correct date over the phone upon receipt of the initial wrong confirmation.  Delta advised there is a 24 hour cancellation policy, and such is also found on the Alitalia website, but Alitalia has refused to honor their policy, let alone correct a mistake that probably occurred on their end.  Why is it so difficult to refund a ticket when there was an obvious mistake, Alitalia was immediately notified and the traveler booked a flight for the correct date and time?  Unless I receive a refund I will be suing for not only the refund but also for unfair business practices and seeking punitive damages for the unfair trade practice under California Business and Professions Code 17200.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My confirmed round-trip flights JFK-IKA (YIODNO) were canceled. I was informed of cancellation by a very unrecognizable email from &#039;NOREPLY&#039; and with a &#039;subject&#039; description in Italian. I was lucky I didn&#039;t delete the email right away since it had no indication it&#039;s from Alitalia and looked suspicious .
The email had very little information on &#039;why&#039; the flight was canceled only showing new dates for my flights already booked and confirmed flights with Alitalia. I called the (800)223-5730 number twice and spoke to two associates. To the first associate I explained that I booked the flight on Nov. 19th to accompany my elderly parents who already have tickets on that date. She suggested I check with my parents to see what are their new dates since their flight must have canceled as well. This made sense and I contacted my parents. To my surprise, my parents had received an email offering them to upgrade their flights to &#039;Business Class&#039; without any mention of the cancellation. So I called back the (800)223-5730 number and spoke to the second associate who initially had no idea why my flights were changed. Then she came back explaining that flight from Rome to IKA on Nov. 20 was canceled. I told her about my parents flights and that theirs were not canceled and in fact they were offered to upgrade to Business Class on the same flight as my Nov. 19th flight. So she said she will send a cancellation notice for my parents flights to my email address. No accountability! Just covering the track of mistakes. 
When I complained about the way I was informed of my cancellation with the inconspicuous email from &#039;NOREPLY&#039; she interrupted me and said, &quot;If you want to complain about the email, send an email to this email address....&quot; So this time I was really offended by the conduct and asked to talk to a manager. She refused to pass the call to a manager and when I insisted, she put me on hold to &quot;TRY&quot; and find a manager for me. She returned after a few minutes and told me that the &quot;ONLY&quot; manager on the staff doesn&#039;t have time to talk to me. She added, &quot;You are REQUIRED to email your complaint to the email address...&quot; WHAT A TRAVESTY of customer service! If this is how Alitalia treats its customers then I am sorry for Alitalia and Italia to have such a rubbish airline.  I found out from the agent that the customer contact center is in Albania which is ok as long as the agents are trained how to handle a customer who has a reason to be upset. I pay and book my ticket to be treated like a king, a customer is king. Not to be treated as if you have to take it or leave it. What a travesty of customer treatment. Cannot say enough!! 
If you have any intention of improving your customer service call me to hear the full story. My # is 1(631)-278-2958.]]></description>
