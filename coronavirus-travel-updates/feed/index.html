					<description><![CDATA[Dear Korean Air,

I was supposed to return to Dallas, TX last April but because of the Corona Virus pandemic I was advised by my travel agent to cancel my return flight.  I need to return before my cancelled return ticket expires in December, what are the requirements needed before I re=book my return flight.  I have tried to call the Manila office of Korean Air, but in vain as all three numbers given to me are not taking live calls and that all mail boxes are said to be full.  Please advise.  I have been a regular Korean Air passenger for the past couple of years and at this point I am very disappointed not to be able to connect with you.  Plead advise on what i need to do. 

Thank you kindly.  I look forward to hear from you.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear people of Turkish Airways, I came to Belgium for a period of leave. When I wanted to go back to Mali for my work, your flights from Brussels were cancelled due to the coup in Mali. My company has booked flight tickets via Frankfurt on September 2. I had a negative coronavirus test result from Mali and a negative test for August 22. When I arrive in Mali, I have to undergo a new coronavirus test done by Malian authorities. Do I need anything special for my departure from Frankfurt on the 2nd of September? (BOOKING REF: V3HV8B, Rudy Windey)]]></description>
