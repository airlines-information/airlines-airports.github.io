					<description><![CDATA[I tested positive for covid 19 on the 24/06/2021. I am flying out to Britain via Air France on the 7/07/2021. I will be self isolating for the the next 14 days. How will I be able to fly as I will not be able to get a negative covid result even though I will no longer be contagious and had no symptoms, the virus will still be in my system and might result in a postive test for the next 3 months. Please an urgent reply is required.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[GOOD AFTERNOON
I would like to ask if the person been tested positive with corona virus and already completed the quarantine period and 
if they  repeat swab PCR the result might be positive as still in the incubation period. However if this person need to fly back to Saudi 
for working purpose, is there any MINIMUM CT value level stated by your airline?
Your respond on this matter is highly appreciated
