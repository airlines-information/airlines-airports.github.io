					<description><![CDATA[My family travelled from Visakhapatnam,India to Hanoi via Kuala Lumpur on 10-11 Dec 18 in air Asia flights. It was showing as connecting route but after booking I realised that it&#039;s not a connecting route. So I was required to pick and check in luggage at Kuala Lumpur. So I applied for E-visa for Malaysia so I can pick and check in luggage again. 
However I was told at Kuala Lumpur that E visa can&#039;t be stamped because the next flight is same day. 
Air Asia staff told me that it&#039;s a routine problem and I m required to apply for missing baggage at Hanoi and they would send it by next flight.
I am now applying for missing baggage.
This is a systemic crime by the airlines to operate and book tkts in such manner to lure customers in manner that can jeopardize a persons safety. 
My mother&#039;s medicine are in the check in luggage.....who is responsible. This is going to cost.]]></description>
