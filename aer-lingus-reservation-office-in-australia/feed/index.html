					<description><![CDATA[Hi we have booked 2 flights , one with 4 persons and the other 2 persons  [ ref 263CQB  , 2IZXHJ ] both are Stobart air and restrict carry on 
our bags are 480high x 350 wide x 200 deep meaning we are over by 20 mm on the width . We purchased the smallest carry on we could in Australia from Strand bags [ American tourister brand ]. can you advise us on if this extra 20mm will matter or how best to get around it
