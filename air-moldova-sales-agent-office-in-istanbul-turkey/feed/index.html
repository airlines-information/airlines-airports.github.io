					<description><![CDATA[Dear Madame/Sir!

I have booked a flight from Istanbul to Chisinau through Air Moldova company. The flight is on December 4, 2019, at 17:00pm. The PNR code: PZXN0. The company I booked the ticket from was En uygun (www.enuygun.com).I got the email with the details of the flight and while trying to do the check in I realised that the position of last and the first name was written the other way around, for example on the ticket it comes in this position: Akhmedov Oibek. But it should be written like this: Oibek Akhmedov. The first name is: Oibek, the last name is: Akhmedov. Immediately we called the enuygun website (where the ticket was purchased) and let them know about this issue. They said that they will send a note to Air Moldova company about the position of the name and the last name. I would like to mention that there is no mistake in the spelling of the name, it is just the position of last name (it comes before the first name). We chose Air Moldova company because we heard that it is a trustworthy and reputable airline company. We would be very grateful if you could assist us in solving this issue.

Kind regards]]></description>
