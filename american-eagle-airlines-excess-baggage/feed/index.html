					<description><![CDATA[We are flying from Philadelphia to Boston, jet, two ways, first class on American Eagle to take a ten-day cruise. There are two of us. Am I correct: we are each allowed one small bag (length plus height plus width less than 62 inches) that weighs less than 70 pounds and one carry-on that fits your space claims. How much are extra checked luggage that are within the above parameters? How much is a checked bag that&#039;s larger than 62&quot; but within the 70 pound limit? Are American Eagle check-ins at the American Airlines counter? If not where do we check in?]]></description>
