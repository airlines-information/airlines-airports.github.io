					<description><![CDATA[Good day! We are flying to the United States from Cape Town on Turkish Airlines on 7 March and back from Atlanta, Georgia arriving in Cape Town on 7 May. I need help with some things. I read that our laptops need to be packed in our luggage and not taken in our hand luggage. How does this work? Coming from Africa, we never do this!
We are in Istanbul for 8 hours. We were not thinking of leaving the airport, so do we need to get a Turkish Passport?
Thank you very much]]></description>
