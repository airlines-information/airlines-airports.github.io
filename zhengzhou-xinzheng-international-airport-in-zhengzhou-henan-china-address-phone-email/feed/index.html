					<description><![CDATA[1. Is the high speed train to Zhengzhou East station INSIDE THE Zhengzhou International AIRPORT? 
2. If not how far a walk is it? How far a ride?

3. Is the subway to  Zhengzhou East station and Innside Hotel actually inside the  Zhengzhou 
Airport; if not how long a walk is it to the subway?

4. Most importantly for tourists: are there signs in English leading to the trains and subway, and signs in English at the train and subway so we take the right train the right direction?
Thank you. Leslie in NYC]]></description>
