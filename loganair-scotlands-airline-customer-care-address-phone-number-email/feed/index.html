					<description><![CDATA[My wife and I are looking to travel with you from Aberdeen to Southampton return.
We are both 79 and our passports expired in June last year, and we no longer have a driving licence.
Will our old passports be acceptable for ID purposes?.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife &#038; I flew for the first time with Loganair from Southampton to Edinburgh on 2nd September, returning on the 9th.  Two great flights - thank you , and we look forward to flying with you again at Christmas. Hopefully you&#039;ll keep the Embraer  ERJ 145 on this route - so much quieter than a turboprop !  Kind regards. Chris &#038; Jo Walker.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, my name is Bogdan Chrustek and I come from Poland. I am person who is really interested in aircrafts and airlines industry. I am freak of flying and in free time I enjoy reading about aviation in Internet.I must admit, that  LOGANAIR   has interesting web-page and I really like be up to date with it. Moreover I collect items connected with this area, such as safety cards: ,ATR42, ATR72, DHC6, ERJ-135-145 -,Saab340,    and postcards with planes. As I know that removing safety cards from airplanes is strictly forbidden I would like kindly ask you about possibility obtaining gifts from your company. I will be really excited if you decide to send me some materials.
 
Thanks in advance and I wish the airline survived these difficult times for the world and success in future.
