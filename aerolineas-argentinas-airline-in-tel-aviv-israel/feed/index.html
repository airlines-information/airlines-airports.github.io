					<description><![CDATA[My flights with Aerolineas Argentinas were re-scheduled without any announcement.
I found this absolutely occasionally ,every flight company in this world will announce every change by e-mail. This is not the case with Aerolineas. I called the representative in Israel and they said they are responsible only with cargo, nothing else.
The website of this company is a shame, no real information about baggage, fees...nothing. There is nobody responsible with the passenger flights., no information in English, no interest in anything. Can&#039;t think what the situation will be when we will be there, already sorry we choose this destination.]]></description>
