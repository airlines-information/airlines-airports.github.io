					<description><![CDATA[I want to travel from Larnaca in Cyprus to Colombo in Sri Lanka. I am trying to find out what is the maximum weight for my luggage allowed (how many kilos), plus the hand luggage. The Qatar website is not so helpful and the telephone numbers in Cyprus are not functioning.

Can you please answer my inquiry?]]></description>
